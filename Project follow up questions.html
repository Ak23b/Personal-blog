            <h2>My Personal Blog</h2>
            <p>This is my first blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts with you. As a universty student sometimes life can be hard and stressful sometimes, but there're moments where I get excited to learn and get important knowledge about life in general. 
              In short, things will get better and good times will come and those bad times do not really last.
